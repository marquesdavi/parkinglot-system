## Parking Lot System - Wex Bootcamp (dio.me)

### Used techniques summary:
To create the system, object-oriented programming was used, as it offers better organization of the code and makes it easier to understand the functionalities (even though it is a simple system). To obtain better performance and have less memory waste, a thorough analysis was even carried out on the types of data that each variable would be using.

### Features:
- Add car
